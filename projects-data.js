        description: "<strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Early detection of tongue-related diseases is critical, but diagnosis often depends on manual visual inspection by specialists, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and inaccessible in remote or under-resourced areas.<br><br><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed a Deep Learning–based image classification system that analyzes tongue images and predicts possible disease categories. The system automates preliminary screening and assists medical professionals in faster decision-making.<br><br><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Deep Learning (CNN, Transfer Learning), TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Image preprocessing & augmentation.<br><strong>Environment:</strong> Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab",
